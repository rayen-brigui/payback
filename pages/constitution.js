                    State legislatures, the State of San Andreas was granted
                    full autonomy as a state of the union, free from all federal
                    laws and regulations, all past &amp; present case law, and
                    all federal executive authority. As such, we do present this
                    constitution to the Board of Governors of the State of San
                    Andreas to achieve our rightful passage to full self
